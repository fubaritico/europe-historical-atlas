### 2026-09-12 — Genesis: fubaritico-ds → europe-map, Phase 0 + Milestone 1.1

Repurposed the repo from the old `fubaritico-ds` design system into a **3D historical atlas of Europe**
(TypeScript + three.js + Vite). Commits `9dea60e`..`1580921` on `master`. All under a full quality gate.

- **`.claude/` cleanup** — rewrote CLAUDE.md + rules for the three.js project; archived DS/React/Stencil
  skills + agents (and stale `financial-app`/micro-frontend leftovers) to `files/claude-archive/`;
  retooled `/review` to 4 dimensions. `grep fubaritico` → only intentional reminders remain.
- **Quality tooling** (`9dea60e`) — ESLint 9 flat (typed, no React) + Prettier + commitlint + husky
  (lint-staged + type-check + test) + lint-staged. Pinned ESLint 9 / TS 5.7 / tseslint 8.
- **Plans** — roadmap split into `files/plans/roadmap/` chapters; spikes cataloged in `files/spikes/`.
- **DEM spike** (`files/spikes/fetch-dem`) — georeferenced heightmap from AWS Terrarium tiles (no key,
  Web Mercator); emits Int16-metres `.bin` + `.json`.
- **Phase 0.1** (`0934783`) — Vite + three.js bootstrap (renderer/scene/camera/loop/resize, Stats + lil-gui).
  Vendored three source via `opensrc`; fixed `Clock`→`Timer`.
- **Phase 0.2** (`a2d67aa`) — camera viewpoint persisted across reload/HMR (`CameraStateStore`,
  sessionStorage, restore-before-first-render, HMR self-accept + teardown). Vitest + jsdom wired.
- **Milestone 1.1** (`1580921`) — Europe relief from the DEM: `heightmap` port + `reliefMesh` (CPU
  displacement). Height **easing** (plains 1:1, peaks eased toward a target — sharp, NOT blur) → game-map
  look. lil-gui defaults: exag 1.0, ceiling 575, peak-target 1900, smoothing 0. 29 tests.
