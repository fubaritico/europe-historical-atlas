# Known Issues

Put here the know issues to avoid cluttering the context window.

- **SVG-as-texture needs explicit `width`/`height`** (not just `viewBox`): loaded as an `<img>` for a
  three texture, a viewBox-only SVG rasterises to 0×0 → blank/invisible. `compassRoseSvg` sets both.
- **Compass rose loads async** (SVG → Image → texture via `TextureLoader`): it appears a frame or two after
  the relief. No `onError` wired yet; if it silently fails to show, check the data-URL / SVG validity.
- **Texture regen is a full pixel pass** (~1.5M px): heavy dev-panel tweaks (`terrainTexture`) fire on
  release. Kept snappy by a trig-free integer hash (`utils/hash`); a supersample option was considered
  and declined (memory [[portolan-decor-and-line-rendering]] — baked lines hit the same resolution ceiling).
- **DEM asset committed** (`public/heightmaps/europe-dem-z5.bin`, 2.98 MB) so the app runs after a clone;
  its generator (`files/spikes/fetch-dem`) lives in gitignored `files/` — regenerating needs it.
- **Camera reframing after the DEM widening**: the extent changed (bbox now W−45…E78.75), so a persisted
  camera pose can be off-frame → `sessionStorage.clear()` (map camera key `europe-map:map-camera`) for the framed default.
- **Bundle > 500 KB** (three.js) — Vite warns at build; not optimized yet (code-split later if needed).
- **Camera persistence is scene-agnostic**: after a big scene change the restored pose can be off-frame →
  `sessionStorage.clear()` (map camera key `europe-map:map-camera`) for the framed default.
- **Relief orientation** assumed north = −Z, east = +X; verified visually as correct. If a future DEM looks
  mirrored/upside-down, flip `u`/`v` in `reliefMesh` sampling.
- **A11y backlog (M2 HTML-overlay milestone)**: the map is a bare WebGL canvas with no DOM-accessible
  equivalent. Deferred to when the HTML UI overlay lands (roadmap 03): (a) `mapControls` binds arrow/zoom
  keys on `window` and `preventDefault`s them app-wide (only exempting form fields via `isEditableFocused`)
  → scope to a focusable canvas with `role`/`tabindex` and gate on focus; (b) `<canvas>` needs an
  accessible name/role + a keyboard-reachable region list for picking (M1.4/M2); (c) Stats overlay is
  mouse-only. Keyboard zoom (`+`/`-`/PageUp/Down), `prefers-reduced-motion`, and ctrl+wheel passthrough are
  already handled.
